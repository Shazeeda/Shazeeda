🚀 Building tomorrow's tech — one thoughtful commit at a time
Hi, I’m Shazeeda Mohamed — a Criminal Justice major turned Software Developer who fell in love with code for the same reasons I loved the justice system: logic, structure, and solving real-world problems.

After graduating from Fullstack Academy, I now build robust, user-centered web applications using modern technologies across the stack. I thrive at the intersection of creativity and problem-solving — whether I’m optimizing backend logic or creating seamless user experiences on the frontend.


💡 A little about me:
🎓 Graduate of Fullstack Academy — trained in fullstack web development

🛠️ Tech Stack: JavaScript, Node.js, React, SQL, REST APIs, PostgreSQL, AWS Cloud

🧠 Passionate about backend engineering, API architecture, and scalable systems

🌱 Always learning — currently diving deeper into advanced backend patterns and cloud integrations

🧩 Problem-solver at heart, team player by nature
